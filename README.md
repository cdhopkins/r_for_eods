# r_for_eods

This is the GitHub repository related to the analysis of EOD ("Electric Organ Discharge") signals generated by Mormyridae (in Africa) and Gymnotoidei (in South America) fishes. This repository will host code written with R (and possibly MATLAB) within the framework of projects managed by Dr. Carl Hopkins (Cornell Universtity) and partner institutions (Royal Museum for Central Africa, University of Lubumbashi, SAIAB).  Part of this project utilizes low cost audio digitizers for capturing EOD waveforms.  A free snound-card oscilloscope application, "Mormyroscope" is used to digitize EOD waveforms and convert them into a voltage versus time waveform saved in ordinary text format along with important metadata.  Some of the analysis software here is designed to read, edit, display, and measure EOD waveform.
