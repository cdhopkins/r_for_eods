# r_for_eods

This is the GitHub repository related to the analysis of EOD ("Electric Organ Discharge") signals generated by Mormyridae (in Africa) and Gymnotoidei (in South Africa) fishes. This repository will host code written with R (and possibly MATLAB) within the framework of projects managed by Dr. Carl Hopkins (Cornell Universtity) and partner institutions (Royal Museum for Central Africa, University of Lubumbashi, SAIAB).

Some of the code will involve reading data files generated by the software MORMYROSCOPE written by Christian Zeitnitz, Professor of Physics at Wuppertal University, Germany. It is free for non-commercial educational and scientific use. This program will run on Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7/8/10 (32 bit and 64 bit) computers and tablets. It will not install on older versions of Windows.  Mormyroscope allows a computer with a sound card or an external audio digitizer to act as an oscilloscope ideal for recording EODs.  A description of the software is available at: http://mormyrids.myspecies.info/en/node/560
